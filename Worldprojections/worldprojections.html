    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>In order to display the map in different projections using QGIS, I used the Project Coordinate Reference System (CRS) at the bottom right corner of the page.
        From there I would search by projection name or EPSG/ESRI to apply the projection on my map. I also used the plugin called
        Indicatrix mapper which uses constant radius ellipsoid caps. How the caps were displayed showed me the distortions in every map projection.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>In the WGS84 projection, shape and area are preserved until they become distored the closer they are to the poles.
        
    </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff projection does not preserve shape or area. Like most map projections 
        the scale is accurate along the equator and meridian.
    </h3>

    <h2>Psuedo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>Similar to the WGS84 projection, the Mercator projection distorts in shape and area as they get closer to the North and South pole.
        Area distortions vary by latitude but maintains shape, area and distance closer to the equator.
    </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Winkel projection distorts shape, area, distance and directions but maintains its accuracy closer to the equator. 
        We can see this since the shape and area isn't in uniform size as we increase latitude and longitude.
    </h3>

    <h2>Equal Area Cyclindrical Projection</h2>
    <h3>In the Equal Area projection, shape and area are severely distored at the poles. The 
        area near the equator are pretty accurate compared to the Earth.
    </h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this map, it is severely distored at the poles because conic projections don't consider the polar regions.
        The closer you get to the prime meridian and equator, they are more true-to-scale.
    </h3>
    <a href="./maps/54027.png"></a>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Azimuthal projection is projected on what looks like a flat surface which preserves the distance, direction
    and angles but severely distorts the opposite pole.
    </h3>
    <a href="./maps/102016.png"></a>

    <h2>World Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>In the Robinson projection, the shape area has some distortion as you move closer to the poles.
        Distance and direction are distorted on this map. This is the map we always see, so I can tell
        that its main use it to provide a visually appealing projection of the earth.

    <h2>World Polyconic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This Polyconic projection distorts shape, area, direction and angles. The closer
        to the central meridian, the projection is free of distortion. There is less distortion
        going from north to south than there is going east to west.
